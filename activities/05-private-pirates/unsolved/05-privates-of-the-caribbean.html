    <script>
      // 1. Create a closure function `createTreasureMap`

      // 2. Inside the function, create an empty object called `treasures`

      // 3. The should also have a variable called `numberOfTreasures`

      // 4. Return an object with three methods: `setTreasure`, `getTreasures`, and `countTreasures`.

      // 5. The `setTreasure` function should take two parameters, a `location` and a `hint`.
      //    Update the treasures object with the location as the property and hint as the value.
      //    Update the numberOfTreasures number.

      // 6. `getTreasures` should return the treasures object.

      // 7. `countTreasures` should return the `numberOfTreasures` variable

      // The provided code should take your closure function and log out the results in the browser's dev tools
      // If your output matches the output in the README, congrats!

      var blackBeardsTreasure = createTreasureMap();

      blackBeardsTreasure.setTreasure("Coney Island", "Under the pier");
      blackBeardsTreasure.setTreasure("Loch Ness", "On the eastern shore");

      console.log(blackBeardsTreasure.getTreasures());
      console.log(blackBeardsTreasure.countTreasures());
      // This is just our check to make sure treasures isn't exposed directly
      console.log(blackBeardsTreasure.treasures === undefined);
      console.log(typeof treasures === "undefined");

      // Bonus: rewrite the getTreasures function to return only the locations and not the hints
