    <script>
      // This function takes advantage of closures to help us from re-writing the family members' last name
      // We create the function that does some of the work for us in generating our family member...
      function createMemberAdder(lastName) {
        // ...and return a function that brings it together when we're ready to use it
        // With closures, an inner function can "remember" variables from where it was returned
        // In actuality this is just lexical scope in action, functions can access variables outside and above themselves
        return function (firstName) {
          return firstName + " " + lastName;
        };
      }

      // addMember will be a function that stores the last name "Smits" for us
      // This way, we can keep calling addMember with just the family members' first names
      var addMember = createMemberAdder("Smits");

      var member1 = addMember("Jimmy");
      var member2 = addMember("Harry");
      var member3 = addMember("Stacey");
      var member4 = addMember("Carroll");

      // We should expect this to print out the first and last names for all these members
      console.log(member1);
      console.log(member2);
      console.log(member3);
